TCM-SED: A Traditional Chinese Medicine Stroke Evaluation Dataset


ðŸ“– About The Project
TCM-SED (Traditional Chinese Medicine - Stroke Evaluation Dataset) is a specialized evaluation dataset designed to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domain of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a specific focus on stroke.

The rapid advancement of LLMs presents immense opportunities in healthcare. However, evaluating their performance in highly specialized and culturally-specific domains like TCM remains a significant challenge. Existing general medical benchmarks (e.g., USMLE-based) fail to capture the unique theoretical framework, cognitive paradigms, and diagnostic nuances of TCM.

This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a high-quality, expert-validated dataset to:

Rigorously evaluate and benchmark different LLMs on their understanding of TCM stroke knowledge.

Identify the strengths and weaknesses of models, such as knowledge recall vs. clinical reasoning.

Provide a valuable resource for future research in developing and fine-tuning LLMs for the TCM domain.

Our accompanying paper, "Construction and Empirical Study of an Evaluation Dataset for Large Language Models in the Field of TCM Stroke," provides a detailed description of the methodology, construction process, and our baseline evaluation results on GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
TCM-SED consists of 203 questions in Chinese, meticulously crafted and validated by senior TCM experts with clinical experience in stroke.

The dataset is structured into three core paradigms:

Short-Answer Questions (46 questions): To test the model's ability for precise knowledge recall.

Multiple-Choice Questions (137 questions): To test the model's ability to discriminate between fine-grained concepts.

Essay Questions (20 questions): To test higher-order abilities like knowledge integration, clinical reasoning, and text generation.

These questions cover a wide range of knowledge dimensions:

Diagnosis & Pattern Differentiation

Treatment Principles & Methods (Herbal Formulas, Acupuncture)

Fundamental TCM Theory

Interpretation of Classic Texts

Patient Communication & Education

All questions have a unique "Golden Standard Answer" established through a multi-reviewer consensus process.
